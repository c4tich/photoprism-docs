# Migrating from SQLite to MariaDB

*For advanced users only: The instructions for these migrations were provided by a contributor and are not part of the original software distribution.

- Install <https://github.com/techouse/sqlite3-to-mysql> on your host. (openSUSE: `zypper in python-sqlite3-to-mysql`)
- Shutdown your current stack: `docker compose down`
- Add the current snippet of the MariaDB to your Sqlite Photoprism docker compose with the addition of the extra `ports`
  section where you expose port 3306 to the Host. In my case this looked like attachment 1.
- Start the stack again: `docker compose up -d`
- Stop Photoprism: `docker compose stop photoprism`
- On the **host** now run `sudo sqlite3mysql -f <PATH_TO_STORAGE_MOUNT>/storage/index.db -d photoprism -u root -p`. Input the password when asked (on the below example is `insecure`, make sure you use something else)
- Shutdown your current stack again: `docker compose down`
- Edit your `docker-compose.yml` so it uses the MariaDB database you added before. Don't forget to remove the `ports`
  section of the MariaDB Container.
- Start your stack again with `docker compose up -d`
- If this worked you may want to delete the file `index.db` in the `storage` mount since it contains out of date
  information.

!!! warning "Bad Performance"
    Many users reporting poor performance and high CPU usage have migrated from SQLite to MariaDB, so their database schema is no longer optimized for performance. For example, MariaDB cannot handle rows with `text` columns in memory and always uses temporary tables on disk if there are any.

    If this is the case, please make sure that your migrated database schema matches that of a fresh, non-migrated installation. It may help to [run the migrations manually](../../advanced/migrations/index.md) in a terminal using the *migrations* subcommands. However, this does not guarantee that all issues such as missing indexing are resolved.
